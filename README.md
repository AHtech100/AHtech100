I began earning my first dollar at the age of 11. Over the years, I ventured into various businesses, including being an internet service provider, a commission agent, and a forex trader. I achieved significant success in the e-commerce industry. Additionally, I am involved in the modeling and fitness industry. Currently, I am learning coding at UMT and earning a substantial income through various skill sets and outsourcing. I am also hopeful of achieving a seven-figure income in the near future.
